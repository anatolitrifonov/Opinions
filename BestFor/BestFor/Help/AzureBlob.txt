ContainerName can not have underscores.
AzureBlobsContainerName <- can not have underscores.
Block blob name can not contain "\" because it then becomes a CloudBlobDirectory instead of CloudBlockBlob
GetBlockBlobReference(name) 

Will set the permissions on the container to "read blob" and produce the direct link to user's image.
How it will work.
All the need to cache is extension of user's image because path is predefined and extension is the only thing we do not know.
Extension can be received from blob name that was uploaded.
Once uploaded we will store it in cache.
And if user cache blob part is not laoded we will load it once user's image is requested.
We will not store a separate cache of images for now.
1. Every time user uploads the image we will cache the fact that user has an image.
2. We will set the cache flag too stating that cache is up to date.
3. If cache about user's image expires we will go to search blob and return extension.

Not going to do the SAS access thing although the pattern is here.

var sasConstraints = new SharedAccessBlobPolicy();
sasConstraints.SharedAccessStartTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5);
sasConstraints.SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(10);
sasConstraints.Permissions = SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read;

var sasBlobToken = blob.GetSharedAccessSignature(sasConstraints);

return blob.Uri + sasBlobToken;

Problem is that it is not clear "when to regenerate the link?" all the time seems too much.
